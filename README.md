## 🚀 Introduction

## 🎯 Disco Architecture
Welcome! We are the **Disco Architecture** team. Below, we present our approach to integrating AI into the certification process.

Our solution defines both an architectural strategy and a concrete approach to implementing Auto Grading System for Test 1
and AI Feedback Assistant in the certification process. It is designed to address key business requirements and concerns,
ensuring that grading and feedback generation are structured, scalable, and adaptable while maintaining expert oversight and seamless data integration.

By leveraging GraphQL Mesh for data aggregation, the architecture consolidates multiple data sources,
enabling real-time access to structured certification records. At the core of this approach, AI-driven evaluation models process
candidate submissions, generate automated feedback, and incorporate expert validation through a continuous learning mechanism.

Below, you will find detailed ADR records, trade-offs, and solution descriptions, outlining the design and implementation of the system.

## 📌 Problem Statement
As the demand for software architecture certification grows globally, the scalability and sustainability of traditional
evaluation methods face significant constraints. Certifiable, Inc., a leading provider of software architecture certification,
has long relied on manual grading performed by expert software architects. However, with the recent expansion of certification
requirements across the United Kingdom, Europe, and Asia, the organization anticipates a 5–10X increase in the number of candidates
in the coming years. Given the resource-intensive nature of the evaluation process, ensuring scalability, cost-effectiveness, and consistency
in grading outcomes has become a strategic imperative.

### 🏗 Certification Process and Evaluation Complexity
The certification process consists of two distinct evaluation stages, each presenting unique operational challenges:
1. **Test 1: Aptitude Assessment** - a structured evaluation comprising multiple-choice and short-answer questions, requiring manual grading for written responses to assess conceptual and analytical proficiency.
2. **Test 2: Architecture Submission** - candidates submit a comprehensive architectural design, which undergoes expert review based on predefined evaluation criteria, assessing structural decisions, trade-offs, and adherence to industry best practices.

With a fixed one-week turnaround per test and a growing influx of candidates, Certifiable, Inc. encounters several operational constraints that limit
the efficiency and scalability of the grading process.

### 🚨 Key Challenges
- **Manual grading inefficiencies** - evaluating short-answer responses and architectural submissions demands expert judgment, leading to high cognitive load, increased turnaround times, and grading inconsistencies.
- **High operational costs** - expert evaluators are compensated at $50 per hour, making manual grading financially unsustainable as candidate volume increases.
- **Scalability limitations** - the existing process lacks elasticity, making it infeasible to accommodate the anticipated growth without significant delays or compromises in grading quality.
- **Inconsistent feedback quality** - the subjective nature of manual grading introduces variability in assessment outcomes, impacting candidate trust, certification credibility, and alignment with standard evaluation criteria.

### Addressing These Challenges

### 🔍 Trade-offs & Justifications
For a detailed breakdown of architectural decisions and trade-offs, refer to:
-  **[Solutions Trade-off](/doc/solutions-tradeoff/solutions-tradeoff.md)** - justification of why Auto Grading System for Test 1 and AI Feedback Assistant were chosen, detailing the advantages, limitations, and operational impact of the final selections.
- ️ **[AI Solutions Trade-off Evaluation](/doc/solutions-tradeoff/ai-solutions-trade-off-evaluation.md)** - analysis of various AI-driven approaches considered before finalizing the selected solutions.
-  **[ADR (Architectural Decision Records)](/doc/adr)** - key design choices and their rationale.

### 🎯 AI-Driven Solution Approach
Following analysis of business requirements, a brainstorming phase, and a trade-off evaluation,
we identified key high-impact areas where AI-driven automation could enhance the certification process effectively and securely—both
from an operational and technological standpoint to ensuring that Certifiable, Inc. can meet growing demands while maintaining quality and trust.

To address these challenges, AI is introduced in two key areas:
1. **🔍 [Auto Grading System for Test 1](/doc/architecture/ai-flow-description/auto-grading-system-for-test-1.md)** - AI-powered grading for short-answer questions reduces processing time while maintaining accuracy.
    - **Solves:** Manual grading inefficiencies, scalability limitations, and cost inefficiencies.
2. **📝 [AI Feedback Assistant](/doc/architecture/ai-flow-description/ai-feedback-assistant.md)** - AI-enhanced feedback generation ensures consistent, professional, and structured responses, improving the candidate experience.
    - **Solves:** Inconsistent feedback quality and workload on experts.
