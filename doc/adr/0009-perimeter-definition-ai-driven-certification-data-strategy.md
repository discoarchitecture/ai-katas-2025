## üìå Context

The AI-driven certification system demands a robust, scalable, and secure data management strategy that will seamlessly
support grading automation, generate insightful feedback, and enable comprehensive performance analysis.
Given the diverse range of data sources - including historical results, candidate submissions, grading insights, and
certification records - we are committed to implementing a solution that ensures:

- Seamless integration of multiple databases
- Efficient querying and aggregation of large datasets
- Data consistency and integrity across different AI processes
- Security and anonymization of candidate and expert data

To address these challenges, we evaluated various data access strategies and selected GraphQL Mesh as the preferred approach for managing AI-related data interactions.

## üéØ Decision

We have selected GraphQL Mesh as the data aggregation and unification layer for our AI-driven certification platform.
It serves as the backbone of our platform, ensuring that the AI-driven insights are grounded in accurate, secure, and well-structured data.

Key reasons for selecting GraphQL Mesh:
- Unified access layer - GraphQL Mesh allows querying across multiple sources (e.g., Aptitude Test Database, Grading Databases, Certification Data) without requiring a rigid schema migration
- API extensibility - The solution supports REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and other APIs, enabling seamless integration of third-party AI services such as LLM-based evaluations and analytics tools
- Data federation - Mesh provides a single query interface for disparate databases, eliminating the need for complex joins or redundant ETL processes
- Security and anonymization - Supports custom resolvers for anonymizing candidate and expert data before exposure to AI models
- Scalability and maintainability - Reduces dependency on tightly coupled services, ensuring that AI components can evolve without breaking database-level dependencies

## üîç Trade-offs Analysis

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Direct database queries | Low latency, full control over data retrieval | High complexity in query optimization, security risks in direct AI access |
| Traditional REST API gateway | Simple to implement, well-supported | Limited flexibility, difficult to aggregate large datasets from multiple sources |
| GraphQL Mesh (chosen) | Federated access, supports multiple data sources, built-in security resolvers | Requires initial setup effort, caching needs to be carefully managed |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Consequences

- Improved AI data accessibility - AI models can efficiently retrieve structured data for grading, feedback generation, and analytics
- Enhanced security and compliance - ensures data anonymization for candidate and expert profiles before usage in AI workflows
- Long-term extensibility - future integrations (e.g., adaptive learning, plagiarism detection) can be seamlessly added to the schema
