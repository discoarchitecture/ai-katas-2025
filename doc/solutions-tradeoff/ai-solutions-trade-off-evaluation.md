# üìå AI Solutions Trade-offs Evaluation

## Introduction

As part of the AI-driven certification enhancement initiative, our architectural committee conducted an in-depth trade-off analysis to determine the most effective approach to automating the grading and feedback processes. This phase involved:
- Identifying key challenges within the certification workflow.
- Brainstorming multiple AI-driven proposals.
- Evaluating each approach based on scalability, accuracy, operational cost, and explainability.

Before selecting the Auto Grading System for Test 1 and AI Feedback Assistant, several alternative solutions were analyzed. The following sections document these trade-offs, including additional approaches that were considered.

| Rule-based keyword scoring | Simple and explainable model.<br>Easy to implement. | Limited flexibility.<br>Fails on nuanced responses.<br>High false negatives. |
| Pattern-based NLP scoring | More flexible than keyword scoring.<br>Handles synonyms and rephrased answers. | Requires extensive fine-tuning.<br>Still lacks deep contextual understanding. |
| AI-generated scoring with human validation | Provides automation while ensuring accuracy. | Requires human resources for verification.<br>Not fully automated. |
| Blockchain-based grading transparency | Ensures immutability and traceability of scores.<br>Prevents tampering. | High implementation complexity.<br>Not directly related to grading logic. |
| Semi-automated rubric-based scoring | AI-assisted grading based on predefined rubrics. | Limited adaptability.<br>Requires frequent updates to rubric models. |
| Machine learning model trained on past grading decisions | Can learn from historical grading patterns. | Requires large datasets for training.<br>Potential bias in historical data. |
| Hybrid AI-assisted grading (‚úÖ chosen) | Reduces expert workload.<br>Balances automation and human oversight.<br>Scales efficiently. | Requires initial training & fine-tuning.<br>Ongoing model validation. |
| Crowdsourced grading (peer review) | Distributed workload.<br>Reduces cost per submission. | Lacks standardization.<br>Requires additional verification layers. |

**Decision:** A hybrid AI-assisted approach was chosen as it provides the best balance between scalability, trust, and cost-efficiency, while keeping human evaluators involved in edge cases.
