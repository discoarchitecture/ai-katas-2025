# üìå Solution Trade-offs & Selection

## Introduction

As part of the AI-driven certification enhancement initiative, our architectural committee conducted a systematic architectural
review of the existing certification process. The goal was to identify key bottlenecks, explore AI-driven enhancements, and establish a structured decision-making framework
to evaluate potential solutions.

During the initial brainstorming phase, multiple AI-driven proposals were formulated, addressing different aspects of the certification workflow.
These proposals were then formally reviewed, debated, and voted upon by the architectural committee.

Following this evaluation, two key areas were identified as high-impact opportunities for AI-driven automation:
1. **Automated grading for short-answer responses (Test 1)** - To improve scalability, grading accuracy, and reduce manual workload.
2. **AI-generated feedback** - To ensure consistency, reduce grading variability, and enhance candidate experience.

The subsequent sections outline the trade-offs associated with each AI-driven proposal, detailing the rationale behind the final architectural decisions. 
This process ensured that the selected solutions - **[Auto Grading System for Test 1](./AI%20Flow%20Description/Files/Auto%20Grading%20System%20for%20Test%201.md)** and **[AI Feedback Assistant](./AI%20Flow%20Description/Files/AI%20Feedback%20Assistant.md)** - 
align with business goals, operational feasibility, and long-term scalability within the certification ecosystem.

## **üîé Trade-offs Analysis for AI Solutions**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **[Test Agent](../doc/adr/0001-test-agent.md)**
*Objective:* Automate the grading of **Test 1** to speed up the review process and reduce manual workload.

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Manual grading** | Full control over evaluations.<br>No AI training required. | High cost per candidate.<br>Slow turnaround time. |
| **Fully AI-based grading** | Instant evaluation.<br>Scales easily. | Requires extensive training.<br>High risk of misclassification. |
| **Hybrid AI-assisted grading (‚úÖ chosen)** | Reduces workload.<br>Maintains expert oversight. | Requires initial AI training and validation. |

**Decision:** The **Hybrid AI-Assisted Grading** approach was selected because it **reduces expert workload** while **ensuring trust and accuracy**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **[Feedback Agent](../doc/adr/0002-feedback-agent.md)**
*Objective:* Automate and standardize feedback generation while keeping expert oversight.

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Manually written feedback** | Full expert control.<br>Personalized insights. | Slow and inconsistent.<br>High workload. |
| **Predefined feedback templates** | Standardized and fast.<br>No AI bias. | Lacks personalization.<br>Limited adaptability. |
| **AI-generated feedback (‚úÖ chosen)** | Adaptive and structured.<br>Reduces expert effort. | Requires AI monitoring.<br>Needs fine-tuning. |

**Decision:** AI-assisted feedback improves efficiency while allowing expert validation for quality control.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **[Analytics Agent](../doc/adr/0003-analytics-agent.md)**
*Objective:* Identify leaked exam questions and improve overall test security.

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Manual question analysis** | Full control over changes. | Reactive, not proactive.<br>High workload. |
| **AI-based analytics (‚úÖ chosen for future implementation)** | Detects patterns in candidate responses. | Requires data integration and monitoring. |

**Decision:** The Analytics Agent is a future enhancement that complements grading automation but does not directly impact immediate grading needs.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **[Rephrase Agent](../doc/adr/0004-rephrase-agent.md)**
*Objective:* Automatically modify exam questions to prevent leakage.

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Manual rewording by experts** | Ensures quality. | Slow and inconsistent. |
| **AI-based question rephrasing** | Improves security.<br>Scales well. | Needs human verification. |

**Decision:** The Rephrase Agent is valuable but was not a priority compared to grading and feedback automation.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **[Rector Agent](../doc/adr/0005-rector-agent.md)**
*Objective:* Detect knowledge gaps in candidates and adjust testing dynamically.

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Fixed test structure** | Uniform evaluation. | May not reflect actual knowledge levels. |
| **AI-powered adaptive testing** | Identifies weak areas. | Increases test complexity.<br>Requires additional validation. |

**Decision:** Rector Agent adds value but was not selected due to its focus on test structure rather than grading efficiency.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **[Unified Testing Platform](../doc/adr/0006-unified-testing-platform.md)**
*Objective:* Standardize **Test 2** submissions into a structured format for AI analysis.

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Allow various formats (PDF, Draw.io, etc.)** | Flexibility for candidates. | Harder to analyze automatically. |
| **Force standardized format (‚úÖ chosen for future implementation)** | Enables AI evaluation of Test 2.<br>Improves test consistency. | Requires significant development. |

**Decision:** The Unified Testing Platform is valuable but requires more investment before AI grading can be applied to Test 2.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **[Anti-Plagiarism Agent](../doc/adr/0008-anti-plagiarism-agent.md)**
*Objective:* Detect duplicate or copied answers in candidate submissions.

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Manual plagiarism detection** | Ensures full control. | Time-consuming. |
| **AI-powered plagiarism detection (‚úÖ chosen for future implementation)** | Identifies similar responses automatically. | Needs database integration. |

**Decision:** The Anti-Plagiarism Agent is valuable for future expansion but was not prioritized for the initial AI rollout.
